# Statistical-Monitoring-and-Risk-Profiling-of-Clinical-Trials-Data
This project applies statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to identify potential risk signals in clinical trial data using publicly available ClinicalTrials.gov records. The goal is to support **risk-based centralized monitoring (RBQM)** by detecting unusual patterns in enrollment, geographic distribution, and phase-specific trial characteristics.
## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect abnormal enrollment patterns across clinical trial phases
- Analyze geographic clustering and site-level variability
- Identify high-risk trials using statistical and ML-based indicators
- Demonstrate how real-world clinical trial data can support centralized monitoring
