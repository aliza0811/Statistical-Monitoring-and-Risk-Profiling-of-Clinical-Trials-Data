NCT06658522,Right Ventricular Compensation With Sotatercept: A Prospective Single Arm Open Label Phase 4 Study to Evaluate the Effects of Sotatercept on Right Ventricular Function in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (RECOMPENSE),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06658522,RECOMPENSE,RECRUITING,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disease characterized by vascular remodelling resulting in elevated pressures in the pulmonary artery (PA). This elevated pressure ultimately leads to fulminant right heart failure. Current therapeutic options are limited and are centred around vasodilatory medications such as phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and prostacyclin. While these medications allow for the widening of blood vessels that are narrowed due to remodelling, they have no effect on the remodelling itself.

Sotatercept is a novel medication which targets the BMPR2/TGF-β pathway and restore a pro- and anti- proliferative balance to ultimately counteract vascular remodelling. Recent phase 2 and 3 trials showed that treatment with sotatercept led to lower resistance and pressure in the pulmonary vasculature and improved exercise tolerance. However, these results were not coupled with an increase in cardiac output, a change that is seen with other PAH-medications with a primarily vasodilatory effect. These results suggest that cardiac work is reduced and cardiac efficiency is improved in patients being treated with sotatercept, in contrast with conventional PAH therapies. This is a potentially beneficial effect that may result in improved disease control in the long-term. Our study aims to explore the effect of sotatercept on cardiac work and function. We hypothesize that the effects of sotatercept are more beneficial for cardiac function than that of traditional PAH medications.

All participants included in the trial will undergo a screening visit in which it will be checked that all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria are met. The screening visit involves a physical exam, blood draw, 6-minute walk test, right heart catheterization (RHC) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) with contrast to assess fibrosis.

Upon inclusion, all participants will receive a subcutaneous injection of sotatercept starting at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg. Participants will return to the hospital every three weeks for a blood draw, physical examination and an adverse event review. If the laboratory values (specifically haemoglobin and platelet counts) stay stable after the first dose, the dosage will be escalated to 0.7 mg/kg. The dose will not be escalated beyond 0.7 mg/kg.

After 24 weeks of receiving sotatercept, there will be an end of treatment visit including a physical exam, 6-minute walk test, right heart catheterization (RHC) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) with contrast material.",NO,Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension PAH|Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension WHO Group I|Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,DRUG: Sotatercept,"Power per beat, mean pulmonary arery pressure (mPAP) x stroke volume (SV), From enrollment to end of study at 24 weeks|Right ventricular pulmonary artery coupling, End systolic elastance (Ees)/ Arterial elastance (Ea) as derived from pressure-volume loops using right heart catheterization, From enrollment to end of study at 24 weeks","Right ventricular end systolic volume, Right ventricular end systolic volume as measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, From enrollment to the end of study at 24 weeks|Right ventricular end diastolic volume, Right ventricular end diastolic volume as measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, From enrollment to the end of study at 24 weeks|Right ventricular ejection fraction, Right ventricular ejection fraction as measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, From enrollment to the end of study at 24 weeks|Right ventricular mass, Right ventricular mass as measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, From enrollment to the end of study at 24 weeks|Stroke volume, Stroke volume as measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging derived aortic flow, From enrollment to the end of study at 24 weeks|Left ventricular end diastolic volume, Left ventricular end diastolic volume as measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, From enrollment to the end of study at 24 weeks|Left ventricular end systolic volume, Left ventricular end systolic volume as measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, From enrollment to the end of study at 24 weeks|Left ventricular ejection fraction, Left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, From enrollment to the end of study at 24 weeks|Left ventricular mass, Left ventricular mass as measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, From enrollment to the end of study at 24 weeks|End-systolic elastance (Ees), End systolic elastance measured using pressure-volume loops derived from right heart catheteriazation, From enrollment to the end of study at 24 weeks|Arterial elastance (Ea), Arterial elastance measured using pressure-volume loops derived from right heart catheteriazation, From enrollment to the end of study at 24 weeks|End-diastolic elastance (Eed), End-diastolic elastance measured using pressure-volume loops derived from right heart catheteriazation, From enrollment to the end of study at 24 weeks|Right ventricular fibrosis, Righ ventricular fibrosis derived from extracellular volume measurements using Modified Look-Locker inversion recovery MRI sequence, From enrollment to the end of study at 24 weeks",,"Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc",Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE4,20,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2024-512543-23-00|2024-512543-23-00,2025-05-14,2026-05-01,2026-05-01,2024-10-26,,2025-09-22,"Amsterdam UMC, location VUMC, Amsterdam, North Holland, 1081HV, Netherlands",

In PAH, the blood vessels in the lungs become thick and narrow, which makes it harder for blood to flow. This causes high blood pressure in the lungs and overworks the heart. PAH can make it hard to breathe and be active. Some standard (usual) treatments for PAH can treat symptoms of PAH but do not stop PAH from getting worse.

Sotatercept is a study medicine designed to treat PAH. It is a targeted therapy, which is a treatment that works on certain proteins that play a role in causing PAH.

Based on this finding, we designed a proof-of-concept trial comparing two approaches: a guided strategy versus conventional renal denervation. In the guided strategy, we perform additional ablations of main and/or branch renal arteries if immediate post-procedure stimulation still elevates systolic blood pressure (\>=20 mmHg increase compared to baseline).

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Does patiromer allow uptitration of irbesartan, resulting in a significant reduction in albuminuria and blood pressure?
* Does patiromer allow uptitration of irbesartan, resulting in a significant reduction in blood pressure?

The trial contains the following interventions:

* Participants will be switched from their ACEi/ARB to a standardised dose of irbesartan (150 mg/d).
* During two 12-week study periods, participants will receive either patiromer 8.4 g/d or placebo. The order of study periods is randomized.
* At the start of each study period irbesartan will be up-titrated to 300 mg/d.
* After 1 and 6 weeks, at both periods, plasma potassium will be measured and the irbesartan dose will be reduced to 150 mg/d in case plasma potassium exceeds 5.0 mmol/L.
* At 12 weeks from the start of the study period, the endpoints will be assessed.

The first is the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system, which profiles a subject's current health state across 5 dimensions (Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, Anxiety/Depression).

One of the main ways the study will check this is by seeing if people can walk further in six minutes (called the ""six-minute walk test""). Another important (secondary) goal is to see how long it takes for PH-ILD to get worse while people are taking L606. One way the study will measure this is by looking at the distance people walk at different times in the study on different doses of L606. Throughout the study, doctors will also closely monitor for any side effects people have to make sure L606 is safe. People who decide to join this study will be randomly (like tossing a coin) placed into one of two groups: one group will get L606 and the other group will get a placebo, which will look like L606 but will not contain any active medicine.
